TIMING-16#80 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.975 ns between system_i/procesamiento/fir_filter_wrapper_0/inst/filtro_fir/y_5_reg_i_1_psdsp/C (clocked by adc_clk) and system_i/procesamiento/fir_filter_wrapper_0/inst/filtro_fir/y_reg/C[42] (clocked by adc_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
An asynchronous set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_fpga_0 and adc_clk overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 13). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#2 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
An asynchronous set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 12 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks adc_clk and clk_fpga_0 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 15). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
